Smileschool Homepage

How to Run

Clone or download the repository.

Open index.html in your preferred web browser.

Ensure the images/ folder and styles.css are in the same directory as index.html.

Notes

All styling is handled in the external CSS file (styles.css).

Additional videos or pros can be added by duplicating the respective HTML blocks.

The design closely follows the Figma prototype for consistency.
